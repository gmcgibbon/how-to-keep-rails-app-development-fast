            ## How to keep Rails app development fast

            #### [Gannon McGibbon](https://gannon.io/)

            Note:

            ---
            ## üëã Hi, I'm Gannon

            ![Gannon](images/me.jpg)

            - Works at Shopify
            - Committer on Ruby on Rails
            - Organizes Winnipeg.rb
            Note:
            - Intro
            ---
            ## Let's talk about development

            # üë®‚Äçüíª

            Note:
            - I'd like to talk about Rails app development
            ---
            ## When we first start our app

            <video id="rails-new" src="images/rails-new.mp4"></video>

            Note:
            - When we first start a Rails app
            - Very small, fast
            - Life is good
            ---
            ## Developers build features

            <video id="rails-scaffold" src="images/rails-scaffold.mp4"></video>

            Note:
            - Over time, our codebase grows
            - Deadlines are set
            - Code gets written
            ---
            ## Over time, things slow down

            <video id="rails-boot-1" src="images/rails-boot.mp4"></video>

            Note:
            - One day you pull latest
            - You notice the app is really slow
            - You don't know why this is happening
            - You don't know for how long either
            ---
            ## Does this sound familiar?

            # ü§î

            Note:
            - Sounds familiar, right?
            - This happens to everyone
            - More developers, more problems
            ---
            ## Should we fix this?

            # üí∏üí∏üí∏

            Note:
            - Do we need to fix this?
            - We could also just buy better hardware
            - New laptops and better servers cost money
            - If you have that money, it could bail you out
            ---
            ## Should we fix this?

            ```sh
            > bundle add spring --group development
            ```
            ```sh
            > bundle exec spring binstub --all
            * bin/rake: Spring inserted
            * bin/rails: Spring inserted
            ```

            Note:
            - The spring gem can be used
            - This can help, but doesn't solve things
            - You're still booting, just less often
            ---
            ## Should we fix this?

            # ‚è±Ô∏è

            Note:
            - Developer time is still being wasted
            - The price needs to be paid regularly
            - More developers, more time lost
            ---
            ## How do we fix this?

            # ü§î

            Note:
            - The question becomes, how do I fix this?
            - Most developers would say use a profiler
            - They're right
            ---
            ## Profiling

            ```sh
            > bundle add stackprof --group development
            ```
            ```rb
            # config/boot.rb

            if (mode = ENV["STACKPROF_MODE"])
              interval = ENV.fetch("STACKPROF_INTERVAL", 1000)
              require "stackprof"
              StackProf.start(mode: mode.to_sym, raw: true, interval: interval.to_i)

              at_exit do
                StackProf.stop
                data = StackProf.results
                File.write("tmp/stackprof-boot.json", JSON.generate(data))
              end
            end
            ```
            ```sh
            > STACKPROF_MODE=wall bin/rails runner ""
            ```

            Note:
            - We instrumnent our app with a profiler
            - In this case stackprof
            - Run the app with STACKPROF_MODE=wall
            - This will give us a file
            ---
            ## Profiling

            ![Speedscope](images/speedscope.png)

            Note:
            - Feed this into a visualizer
            - In this case speedscope
            - We get a graph of what the app's doing
            ---
            ## Profiling

            ```rb
            # config/initializers/tax_rates.rb

            Rails.configuration.to_prepare do
              TaxService.load_rates
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Someone added an initializer
            - That initializer does a GET request
            - That GET can take a long time
            ---
            ## Profiling

            ```rb
            # app/models/tax_service.rb

            class TaxService
              class << self
                def load_rates
                  Rails.cache.fetch("tax_rates", expires_in: 1.day) do
                    api_client.get_rates
                  end
                end
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - We can fix this with caching
            - Caching helps us do expensive work less often
            - But we could go further
            ---
            ## Profiling

            ```rb
            # lib/tasks/tax.rake

            namespace :tax do
              task load_rates: :environment do
                TaxService.load_rates
              end
            end
            ```
            ```sh
            > bin/rails tax:load_rates
            ```

            Note:
            - We could extract the code into a task
            - It doesn't have to happen at boot at all
            - Let's say we do that
            ---
            ## Profiling

            # üòä

            Note:
            - Regression fixed
            - It works, great!
            - Problem solved
            ---
            ## Fast-forward a month

            <video id="rails-boot-2" src="images/rails-boot.mp4"></video>

            Note:
            - Fast-forward a month
            - We pull the latest
            - We notice yet another regression
            ---
            ## How do we prevent this?

            # ü§î

            Note:
            - We could keep fixing these issues
            - We should investigate
            - Maybe we should also ask how we can prevent this?
            ---
            ## I've been working on this problem

            ![Commit Graph](images/commit-graph.png)

            Note:
            - Myself and a few others from Shopify have been working on this
            - We've fixed lots of regressions on our monolith
            - Through this, we've built up a simple mindset
            ---
            ## Why are we booting the app?

            ```txt
            => Booting Puma
            => Rails 7.2.1 application starting in development
            => Run `bin/rails server --help` for more startup options
            Puma starting in single mode...
            * Puma version: 6.4.2 (ruby 3.3.4-p94) ("The Eagle of Durango")
            *  Min threads: 3
            *  Max threads: 3
            *  Environment: development
            *          PID: 59468
            * Listening on http://127.0.0.1:3000
            * Listening on http://[::1]:3000
            * Listening on http://127.255.255.0:3000
            * Listening on http://127.0.2.2:3000
            * Listening on http://127.0.2.3:3000
            Use Ctrl-C to stop
            ```

            Note:
            - That mindset is to ask yourself why
            - Always ask yourself why the app is being booted
            - Under what context is a peice of code important?
            ---
            ## Autoloading and eager loading

            ![Autoloading Guide](images/autoloading-guide.png)

            Note:
            - In development, we use autoloading to do as little as possible
            - In production, we eagerly load everything to make requests quick
            - But there's more to think about
            ---
            ## What we do when we develop apps

            - Write code
            - Run tests
            - Run the server
            - Run tasks

            Note:
            - When building a Rails app, we do several things
            - For each of these, we boot the app
            - For each of these, we often load code we don't need to
            - I'll review examples
            ---
            ## Writing code

            ```sh
            > bin/rails g resource user
            ```
            ```sh
            > code my_app
            ```

            Note:
            - When writing code, we use generators which boot the app
            - These days, we also use language servers (LSP)
            - This can boot Rails too
            ---
            ## Writing code

            ```rb
            # config/initializers/tax_rates.rb

            Rails.configuration.to_prepare do
              TaxService.load_rates
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - For example
            - Do we need those tax rates to write code?
            - Really any business logic at all?
            ---
            ## Writing code

            ## ‚ùå

            Note:
            - Probably not, no.
            ---
            ## Running tests

            ```sh
            > bin/rails test test/models/user_test.rb
            ```
            ```rb
            # test/models/user_test.rb

            require "test_helper"

            class UserTest < ActiveSupport::TestCase
              test "the truth" do
                assert true
              end
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Running tests boots the app
            - Specifically in the test helper
            - We need to to access constants
            ---
            ## Running tests

            ```rb
            # app/models/app_schema.rb

            class AppSchema < GraphQL::Schema
              query QuryRoot
              mutation MutationRoot
            end
            ```

            Note:

            - Do we need a GraphQL schema to run tests?
            ---
            ## Running tests

            ## ‚ùì

            Note:
            - We might
            - There is yet more nuance to this answer
            - We do need it for GraphQL tests
            ---
            ## Running the server

            ```sh
            > bin/rails server
            ```
            ```txt
            Started GET "/users" for ::1 at 2024-09-21 21:19:13 -0500
            Processing by UsersController#index as HTML
              Rendering layout layouts/application.html.erb
              Rendering users/index.html.erb within layouts/application
              Rendered users/index.html.erb within layouts/application
              Rendered layout layouts/application.html.erb
            Completed 200 OK in 44ms
            ```

            Note:
            - The server boots the app
            - Then it boots the app server
            ---
            ## Running the server

            ```rb
            # app/models/user.rb

            class User < ApplicationRecord
              validates :first_name, presence: true
              validates :email, presence: true
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Do we need the User model to boot the app?
            ---
            ## Running the server

            ## ‚ùì

            Note:
            - We probably do
            - There is yet more nuance to this answer
            - We'll likely use it, just not upfront
            ---
            ## Running tasks

            ```sh
            > bin/rails db:migrate
            ```
            ```txt
            == 20240921065947 CreateUsers: migrating ================
            -- create_table(:users)
              -> 0.0011s
            == 20240921065947 CreateUsers: migrated (0.0011s) =======
            ```

            Note:
            - Tasks like database migrations boot the app
            - Precompiling assets and running the dbconsole do too
            ---
            ## Running tasks

            ```rb
            # config/routes.rb

            Rails.application.routes.draw do
              root to: "home#index"
            end
            ```

            Note:
            - Do we need routes to run migrations?
            ---
            ## Running tasks

            ## ‚ùå

            Note:
            - We do not.
            ---
            ## Wait, no routes?

            ![Lazy Routes](images/lazy-routes.png)

            Note:
            - Today, Routes are always drawn at boot
            - Part of my team's work was to fix this in edge Rails
            - In an upcoming release, routes will be drawn lazily in dev and test
            ---
            ## Watching less files

            ![I18n Watcher Optimization](images/i18n-watcher.png)

            Note:
            - We also made optimizations to file watching

            ## Restricting boot-time network IO

            ```rb
            # lib/patches/net_http.rb

            class RestrictedTCPSocket < TCPSocket
              class << self
                attr_accessor :ready

                def open(remote_host, remote_port, ...)
                  raise "Not ready yet" unless ready
                  super
                end
              end

              self.ready = false
            end
            Net::HTTP::TCPSocket = RestrictedTCPSocket
            ```

            Note:
            - And banned network requests on boot

            ## The "leak" pipeline

            ```rb
            # frozen_string_literal: true

            require "bundler/setup"
            require "active_support/lazy_load_hooks"

            ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) { raise LoadError }
            ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_model) { raise LoadError }

            require_relative "../config/environment"

            raise LoadError if defined?(Google::Cloud::Storage)
            raise LoadError if defined?(Pry)
            ```

            Note:
            - What I really want to talk about is
            - The script we wrote to catch speed regressions
            - This is a crude version that fits on one slide
            - We call it the leak pipeline
            ---
            ## The "leak" pipeline

            ```rb[3-4]
            # frozen_string_literal: true

            require "bundler/setup"
            require "active_support/lazy_load_hooks"

            ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) { raise LoadError }
            ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_model) { raise LoadError }

            require_relative "../config/environment"

            raise LoadError if defined?(Google::Cloud::Storage)
            raise LoadError if defined?(Pry)
            ```

            Note:
            - First we setup bundler and require load hooks
            - If you're not familiar, load hooks are callbacks for autoloaded Rails classes
            - Classes have callbacks because they're slow to load
            ---
            ## The "leak" pipeline

            ```rb[6-7]
            # frozen_string_literal: true

            require "bundler/setup"
            require "active_support/lazy_load_hooks"

            ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) { raise LoadError }
            ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_model) { raise LoadError }

            require_relative "../config/environment"

            raise LoadError if defined?(Google::Cloud::Storage)
            raise LoadError if defined?(Pry)
            ```

            Note:
            - We setup load hooks for Active Record and Active Model
            - We define these before booting to make sure they run first
            - There are many more to hooks in Rails
            ---

            ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) { raise LoadError }
            ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_model) { raise LoadError }

            require_relative "../config/environment"

            raise LoadError if defined?(Google::Cloud::Storage)
            raise LoadError if defined?(Pry)
            ```

            Note:
            - We boot the application with this require

            ## The "leak" pipeline

            ```rb[11-12]
            # frozen_string_literal: true

            require "bundler/setup"
            require "active_support/lazy_load_hooks"

            ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_record) { raise LoadError }
            ActiveSupport.on_load(:active_model) { raise LoadError }

            require_relative "../config/environment"

            raise LoadError if defined?(Google::Cloud::Storage)
            raise LoadError if defined?(Pry)
            ```

            Note:
            - We can then use Ruby's defined? method to check for constants
            - We're defining checks for heavier gems like GCS and Pry

            ![Boot Graph](images/boot-graph.png)

            Note:
            - With that script and hours of profiling
            - We were able to cut down the boot time of our app from 12.5 seconds to 4 seconds
            - Better yet, we've only seen 1 major regression
